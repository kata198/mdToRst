1.0.0 - Aug 1 2017

Version 1.0.0 - Works pretty well perfect across all my projects.


 * Escape special characters within preformatted text. Markdown does not
 interpret within preformatted text, but RST tries to... This ensures
 equivilant output

 * Replace leading sets of 4 spaces with tabs in RST output, to simplify a lot
 of the code and keep display the same

 * Some additional logic on differeing whitespace and consecutive lines, cases
 where MD inserts a linebreak but RST needs an explicit, and cases where they
 are the same.


0.2.0 - Jul 31 2017
 * Several cleanups, performance improvements

 * Split out line additions and inline replacements (the first for differences
 in multi-line styling, the second for inline changes). The inline engine runs
 through every rule on every line in sequence. The "line additions" engine
 runs only on the first matching rule

 * Support hyperlinks, the < http://www.example.com > variety, as well as the
 named links like [ The Name ] < http://www.example.com >
 
 * Support conversion of underscores for emphasis/bold in markdown to stars

 * Unification of engine to make easily extensible and grouped

0.1.0 - Jul 30 2017
 * Initial Release
